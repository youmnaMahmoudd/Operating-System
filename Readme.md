<h2> Process Scheduler Desktop App </h2>
This is a desktop application that implements several process scheduling algorithms. The app allows users to simulate the execution of a set of processes using different scheduling algorithms, and compare the results.

<h2>Features </h2>
The app supports the following scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Priority Scheduling
Round Robin (RR)

Users can input the details of a set of processes, including their arrival time, burst time, and priority (if using priority scheduling). The app then simulates the execution of these processes using the selected scheduling algorithm, and displays the results, including the order in which the processes are executed, the waiting time and turnaround time for each process, and the average waiting time and turnaround time for the entire set of processes.
The app also allows users to adjust the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm, and provides a visual representation of the Gantt chart for the selected scheduling algorithm.

<h2> Installation </h2>
To run the app, you will need to have the following software installed:
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or later
Apache Maven version 3.x or later

<h2> Usage </h2>
Launch the app by running the JAR file, as described in the Installation section.

Choose a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Input the details of the processes you want to simulate, including their arrival time, burst time, and priority (if using priority scheduling).

Click the "start" button to run the simulation.

View the results, including the order in which the processes are executed and the average waiting time and turnaround time for the entire set of processes.

Adjust the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm in the separate screen, when asked.

View the Gantt chart for the selected scheduling algorithm.

Repeat steps 2-7 with different scheduling algorithms and process inputs to compare the results.
